  - __Fall-back Plan__:

    - Plan 1: Paper model of Roosevelt island/Cornell Tech with smart features (weather, transportation, night lights etc.)
    - Plan 2: Reduce the features in our bud


- __Functioning Project__: 

    We are passionate about both cats and plants and want to make our BUD that exhibits both feline and plant-like characteristics. We would like our BUD to mimic the behaviors and characteristics of a cat, such as being independent and sometimes unpredictable, and also to exhibit plant-like qualities such as responding to light and needing watering. We hope that their robot will be able to exhibit both sets of characteristics in a way that is realistic and engaging.


    The completed BUD is a robotic plant plot that functions as a cat and has the following features (with demo videos):
    ![this is an image](https://github.com/JMortonTan/bud-cornell-tech-idd-final/blob/main/features.png)

    - __Features (with people-robot interaction)__:
      - Stay away from stranger (Need some personal spances): https://youtu.be/u5x-O6yp5lo

        Cats are generally more reserved and cautious around strangers than dogs. They may take longer to warm up to new people and may keep their distance until they feel comfortable and safe. Thus, It's important to respect a cat's boundaries and allow them to approach and interact with new people on their own terms. Due to the above cat nature, we decided to make our BUD stay away from strangers using two IR proximity sensors in the front. When people try to approach the BUD in the front, the BUD will move backwards for a bit. 

      - Butt Scratch: https://youtu.be/7XOs2DJO2yg

        Many cats do enjoy having their buttocks scratched or massaged, as it can feel soothing and provide a sense of comfort and relaxation. Therefore, we added a Butt Scratch feature in our BUD using impact switches and RGB LED lights. 

      - Recognize Owner: https://youtu.be/gSTwQe7AVko

        Cats are capable of recognizing their owners and other familiar people. They use a variety of cues to identify individuals, including sight, smell, and sound. Studies have shown that cats are able to recognize their owner's face and voice, and may even be able to distinguish between different people's voices. In order to demonstrate the ability for our BUD to recognize its owner, we have decided to utilize computer vision and voice detection techniques using a camera equipped with a built-in voice detector in our design.

    - __Features (without people-robot interaction)__:

      - Exploring the world with curiosity: https://youtu.be/jinE7tJCbvE

        Cats are known for their curiosity and desire to explore their surroundings. They are naturally inquisitive animals and may spend a lot of time investigating new objects, sounds, and smells. Thus, we added an exploring feature in our BUD using impact switch collision sesor.

      - Zoomie :https://youtu.be/Q4AVnUg-z1g

        "Zoomies" is a term that is often used to describe a behavior that some cats exhibit when they suddenly start running around and playing vigorously. This behavior is also sometimes referred to as "frenetic random activity periods" (FRAPs). Zoomies can occur at any time and are often triggered by excitement or the release of pent-up energy. Some cats may have zoomies more frequently than others, and the behavior may be more common in young cats or cats that have a lot of energy. Zoomies can be a normal and healthy part of a cat's behavior, but it's important to ensure that they have a safe and appropriate place to play and run around. Therefore, we make our BUD Zoomie sometimes. 

      - Sunlight Chasing: https://youtu.be/p_VLosO4qjc

       Since our BUD  is designed to be cat-like but also incorporate plant-like features, it will need sunlight in order to generate the energy it needs to function. To ensure that the robot is getting enough light, we planned to use IR sensors and camera to measure the amount of light present in the environment. This will allow BUD to adjust the location and ensure that it has access to sufficient light.


      - I want water dance: https://youtu.be/mdTZZOwKOjE
        
        We have noticed that plants can be difficult to care for because they cannot communicate their needs to humans directly. As a result, they may not receive the watering they need in a timely manner. In order to help address this issue, we would like to include a feature in our BUD robot that uses a water level sensor to alert people when the plant needs to be watered. This will make it easier for the robot to communicate its needs and help ensure that it receives proper care. In our BUD, when water level is not sufficient, BUD wil start dancing to raise owners' attention.

- Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)
  - Jonathan Tan:
    
    In this project we started with a unique idea, to combine the actions of raising plants, and raising pets.

    This was unique because it was a very open ended proposition. Â What kind of interactions should, would and are required in order to properly raise a plant?

    To quickly get to the point, I really wish I understood more about robotics at the beginning of the project.

    We spent a ton of time understanding how to interface Arduino and Raspberry Pi in order to allow Raspberry Pi to handle computing functions such as CV, and Arduino to handle controlling the motors. Â We also spent a ton of time learning about robotics kits, power requirements and what kind of chassis we should purchase in order to fulfill basic functions such as mobility rotation, and expandability to add sensors. Â Then, it was another journey to research and understand what type of sensors we were interested in using.

    Only after this was handled, were we able to begin ideating "What kinds of behaviors would a mechanized plant require in order to survive?" "What type of personality would it have or try to mimic?" "What are some typical interactions between a human and a pet?"

    Here we were most able to apply the ideation processing, storyboarding, and interactions that we had reviewed in the class. Â We really wish we hadn't underestimated the basic knowledge required in robotics, such as calculating voltage and amperage requirements for various kits. Â Especially since in the end, we decided to purchase a kit that had a power system predesigned for the chassis. Â We also utilized much of the time soldering and creating a wiring harness that allowed the Pi and Arduino to interact with one another. Â Although the kit was compatible, it required significant modification in order to physically bridge the two "brains".

    All in all, we really discovered that robotics is not as simple as a python script to set a motor to move a certain distance. Â There are in fact several different types of motors for different types of movement as well (servo etc.). Even two motors of the same model and type may not perform the same.

    We wish we had known this a bit earlier, and perhaps would have directly purchased a kit without wasting time believing it was possible to do on our own. Â This way we could quickly focus on developing features and interactions, which was the most important aspect of the project.


  - Peggy Pei:

    Building the plant-like robot "BUD" was the fascinating project I have ever built. That allowed me to explore the hardware (Ex. Raspberry Pi), software, and tools used for building interactive devices. My teammate Jon and I are both plant and cat lovers. Thus, the goal of our project was to make an interactive pet-like plant plot. To achieve our goals, we decided to use the technics we learned in classes to combine plants with robots.Â 

    One of the main challenges we faced during this project was the high energy consumption of our robot. Initially, we relied on a plug-in power source, but this limited the mobility of the robot. As a solution, we created a battery pack for the robot. However, the added weight of the battery pack made the robot kits heavy, and the six-battery pack only allowed the robot to run for 20 minutes before running out of energy. This time, we could not overcome this limitation on time. We will continue to experiment with self-sustaining energy sources in an effort to improve the energy consumption issue.

    Additionally, this was my first time working with maker tools, such as soldering and wire-cutting tools. To familiarize myself with these tools, I watched numerous YouTube tutorials. I found the experience of using these tools to be very interesting and would like to continue learning more about them in the future.

    Overall, the project was a success, and the plant-like robot could move and behave in a manner that was remarkably similar to a real cat. It was a great learning experience, and I feel that I gained a greater understanding of both engineering and interactive devices as a result.
