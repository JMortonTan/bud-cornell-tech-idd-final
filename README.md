CS5424-Final Project

- __Project Plan__
  - __Big idea__:

    The "bud" is a hybrid plant-robot that turns your indoor potted plant into a house pet. It has features such as water monitoring and sunlight chasing, as well as additional pet-like characteristics. With "bud," your plant becomes a 100% companion.

  - __Parts Needed__:
  - __Fall-back Plan__:

- Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

- Documentation of design process

- Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)

- Video of someone using your project

- Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

- Group work distribution questionnaire
